Research Interests
----------

My research interests include cloud computing, high performance computing, big data and resource management. Specifically, I'm interested in designing and building cost-efficient resource management systems for the cloud and HPC, with an emphasis on big data applications.

Scholarly Research Achievements at a Glance

My research goal is to make efficient, scalable and secure data management systems for big data applications
in the wide area. To this end, I focus on characterizing the complicated data communication patterns of big
data applications and capturing the heterogeneous features of underlying wide area infrastructures; and on
designing new data management approaches to improve the performance and cost efficiency of data-intensive
applications, considering data privacy concerns.
