I am currently an Assistant Professor in the High Performance Computing Research Institute of Shenzhen University. Before that, I was a postdoc fellow of the Ascola team at INRIA Rennes, closely working with Dr. Shadi Ibrahim on big data management and cloud computing. I obtained my PhD degree in 2016 from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, under the supervision of Dr. Bingsheng He. I received my Bachelor's degree in 2009 and Master's degree in 2011 both from Beihang University, China.
